The current increase in property value amounts to $45,410 (or a 9.1% increase).
We've made no improvements to our property in several years and I believe our house and all the homes around us are overvalued.  In addition, taxes have gone up almost 10% the last 3 years in a row.  This is not providing an incentive for residents to remain in the area and at least 2 familes close to us have moved due to dissatisfaction with the constant increase in property taxes.
